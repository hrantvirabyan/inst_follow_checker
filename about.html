    <p>This website was created by a college student who grew tired of apps and services that required users to provide their Instagram login credentials. Concerned about privacy and security, the student developed this website to track Instagram unfollowers without the need for logging in.

      The main purpose of this website is to offer a safe and convenient method for monitoring your Instagram account and keeping track of your followers and unfollowers. By utilizing publicly available information, this tool allows users to stay informed about changes in their follower list without compromising their login credentials.
      
      Please note that this website is strictly for educational purposes and is not affiliated with Instagram. It provides an alternative approach to tracking unfollowers on Instagram without requiring users to share their personal account details. Users are encouraged to use this tool responsibly and in compliance with Instagram's terms of service.</p>
